			One of the aims of this competition is to make debate accessible and engaging to a larger audience; to that end, this style has been adapted from the Canadian National Debating Format.
		</p>

		<h2>Teams</h2>

		<p>
			Debaters will debate in school teams of two, representing either the Proposition arguing in favour of the resolution, or the Opposition arguing against the resolution.
		</p>

		<h2>Topics</h2>
		<p>
			Rounds 1 and 2 will be on a prepared motion, while rounds 3, 4, 5 will be impromptu. Topics will focus on a variety of Canadian issues. Some may require models for implementation, though some rounds will be principled in nature. Squirreling is not permitted; debaters should strive to debate the spirit of the motion offered, as fairly and reasonably as possible. Any topic clarifications should occur at the announcement of the topic directly with the tournament organizer.
		</p>


		<h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>

		<p>
			Rounds will be tabulated based primarily on win-loss, though speaker scores will be used for individual prizes and to break ties. Debaters will be scored based on <b>style</b> (30%), <b>content/argumentation</b> (30%), <b>rebuttal/responsiveness</b> (30%), and <b>POIs</b> (10%). Speaker scores should fall between <b>75 (poor) and 95 (excellent)</b>.
			<br></br>
			<b>Style</b> includes organization, language use, presentation skills; i.e. how persuasive the speaker sounds, and do you want to keep listening to them.
			<br></br>
			<b>Content/Argumentation</b> includes how well debaters make their constructive arguments. Arguments should be explained fully and use examples where possible and helpful. A good idea that is poorly explained or asserted will get a poor score for argumentation.
			<br></br>
			<b>Rebuttal/Responsiveness</b> includes rebuttal and rebuilding done in both the constructive speeches (if applicable) and the rebuttal/summary speeches. Both the completeness and the quality of rebuttal will be considered. Rebuilding (defending your partner's points against attacks from opponents) is also included in this category.
			<br></br>
			Though a debater may choose not to spend time responding to points that are clearly silly or unimportant, no significant or often discussed issues in the round should go unaddressed. It is not enough to provide a counterexample or reiterate a point already made; debaters should strive to refute the best version of the argument, targeting both what is described by their opponents as well as the arguments’ principled underpinnings.
			<br></br>
			<b>POIs</b> must be offered and taken as described in the below section on POIs. Debaters are to be credited for their involvement in asking and taking POIs, but more so on the quality of the points raised. Debaters who are not asked more than 1 POI during a speech will not be penalized for not taking one.
		</p>

		<h2>Point of Information</h2>

		<p>
			Points of Information (POIs) are a necessary part of engaging with debaters in this style. The expectation is that all debaters ask at least 2 per opponent’s speech, and take 1-2 points during their own speech, though it is at their discretion when and from whom they should take POIs during their  speeches. POIs should be short and to the point. They may be but need not be phrased as question.
			<br></br>
			Debaters may not ask POIs during the first and last minute of their speeches, as this is protected time. No POIs may be asked during rebuttal/summary speeches.
			<br></br>
			Other points (points of personal privilege, points of order) and heckling are not permitted at any time.
		</p>

		<h2>Adjudication and Tabs</h2>

		<p>
			After the two initial rounds, the debates will be bracketed, allowing teams with a similar win-loss record to face one another. After 5 in rounds, the top 8 teams at the tournament will advance to the “Playoffs”—the winners of each Playoff will go on to represent their region at the National Confederation Cup in Ottawa. A maximum of two teams per school can qualify to Nationals.
